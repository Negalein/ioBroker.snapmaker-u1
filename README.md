# ioBroker.snapmaker-u1

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/iobroker.snapmaker-u1.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.snapmaker-u1)
[![Tests](https://github.com/Negalein/ioBroker.snapmaker-u1/actions/workflows/test-and-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Negalein/ioBroker.snapmaker-u1/actions/workflows/test-and-release.yml)

An ioBroker adapter for monitoring a [Snapmaker U1](https://www.snapmaker.com/) through its local Moonraker service, with top-cover fan control, AFC/Spoolman metadata, camera discovery, print-preview URLs and guarded PAXX12 motion, print and optional toolhead controls.

> This is an early development version. The v0.0.3/v0.0.4 control points are deliberately restricted to an explicitly selected **PAXX12** firmware mode. They do not claim compatibility with the original Snapmaker firmware, which has not been validated. Use printer controls only while attending a clear, safe printer.

## Current functionality

### Cameras and print preview

In the settings, open **Discover and select cameras** (German: **Kameras suchen und auswählen**) to retrieve enabled cameras from Moonraker and save a multiple selection. Save the printer host first and keep the adapter running for discovery. No network scan is performed.

Selected cameras are published under `cameras.<Moonraker UID>` with name, enabled flag, stream URL, snapshot URL, service, rotation and mirror settings. The adapter reads camera configuration only; it does not open continuous video streams or claim that a camera is reachable. WebRTC requires a compatible viewer. Historical camera objects remain after deselection but are no longer refreshed.

`printer.job.previewUrl` contains the largest embedded thumbnail of the current G-code file. It is cleared when no file is selected or preview is disabled. Camera/thumbnail failures are logged at debug level and do not mark the printer disconnected. Camera URLs must be reachable from the browser displaying them. Camera discovery, settings and data points have been tested in an installed ioBroker instance with PAXX12. A configured camera entry is not proof of a reachable stream.

Top-cover fan control: write a numeric percentage (0–100, `ack=false`) to `printer.cover.circulation.speed` or `printer.cover.exhaust.speed`. Commands are serialized and acknowledged from a subsequent printer status query. Both fans were live-tested with a five-percentage-point change and restored. Firmware automation may subsequently change fan speeds. Invalid values are rejected.

Enable **Spoolman integration** to read AFC lane material, filament name, color, spool ID, loaded flag and raw status for lanes 0–3, plus the current AFC lane and error flag. Moonraker's Spoolman connection status and active spool ID are exposed under `printer.spoolman`. These values are read through Moonraker; the separate Spoolman URL is reserved for future inventory queries. No spool assignments or consumption reports are written by this adapter.

Read-only status polling has been verified on PAXX12 `2.0.0-paxx12-24`:

- `printer.job`: state, filename, elapsed print duration (seconds), filament used (mm), progress (percent), and paused flag.
- `printer.tools.active`: active extruder name.
- `printer.tools.tool0` through `tool3`: actual temperature, target temperature, and tool status.
- `printer.bed`: actual and target temperature.
- `printer.chamber.temperature`: chamber temperature.

The monitoring states are read-only. The two fan speed states and the guarded PAXX12 control states described below are writable. Missing or invalid values are skipped. The owner has tested version 0.0.2 in ioBroker, including live printer data, cameras, AFC/Spoolman metadata and reconnection after power-off. Original firmware compatibility remains unverified.

- Connects locally to Moonraker at a configurable host and port (default: `7125`).
- Publishes `info.connection`, printer hostname, Klipper software version, status, and the last successful update. The existing state ID `printer.info.firmware` is retained.
- Supports the original firmware and PAXX12 as selectable configuration modes; protocol-specific features will follow after validation against real devices.
- Reads AFC and Spoolman metadata through Moonraker. Direct Spoolman inventory access is not implemented.

### Motion and print control (PAXX12 only)

Set **Firmware mode** to **PAXX12 firmware** to enable the control states. `auto` and `original` modes deliberately reject every Home, Jog, Pause, Resume and Cancel request. This avoids claiming support for the original firmware before it has been physically verified.

Each new motion/print control request first fetches a fresh Moonraker status and passes one central safety check. The adapter sends only fixed, internally generated Klipper commands; it does not expose a free-form G-code state.

- Home commands use `G28` or `G28 X`, `G28 Y`, `G28 Z` and are allowed only when `print_stats.state` is `standby`, `complete` or `cancelled`.
- Jog commands are limited to **0.1–25 mm** at **1–100 mm/s**. They require an idle printer, a homed target axis, finite current coordinates, and Moonraker-reported `axis_minimum`/`axis_maximum` values that contain the target. The generated script saves and restores the Klipper G-code state.
- `Pause` is permitted only while printing; `Resume` only while paused; and `Cancel` only while printing or paused.
- Commands are serialized, buttons reset to `false` after handling, and rejected/failed requests are published in `printer.control.lastError`.

The control commands and their safety rules are unit-tested, but the new motion and job-control paths still need validation on a physical PAXX12-equipped U1 before relying on them in everyday operation.

### Toolhead control (PAXX12 + detected capability only)

Version 0.0.4 does not assume that every PAXX12 printer has the same macros. On startup, periodically, and immediately before every toolhead request, the adapter asks Moonraker for the loaded Klipper objects. It reads Klipper's parsed extruder configuration only to determine the connected printer's safe limits. If discovery is unavailable, the command is rejected; it never falls back to guessed macro names or a free-form G-code state.

The current PAXX12 AFC Lite source documents the `CHANGE_TOOL` and `LANE_UNLOAD` macros for lanes E0–E3. `CHANGE_TOOL` performs its own automatic load as part of the tool change. The adapter uses only these exact macros, and only when both the macro and the matching `AFC_lane E0`–`E3` object are present. A tool change or unload also requires an idle printer and a known, fault-free `AFC.error_state`.

- `printer.control.toolhead.change.e0` through `.e3` issue the fixed `CHANGE_TOOL LANE=E0` through `E3` command. These are **change-and-load** buttons; there is no invented standalone load command.
- `printer.control.toolhead.unload.e0` through `.e3` issue the fixed `LANE_UNLOAD LANE=E0` through `E3` command.
- No parking button is exposed in v0.0.4. No U1/PAXX12 parking macro was verified in the supported firmware source, so `printer.control.toolhead.capabilities.parkToolhead` remains `false` rather than sending an inferred park sequence.
- `printer.control.tools.tool0.target` through `.tool3.target` set individual targets with Klipper's documented `SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE` only if that extruder object and its runtime `max_temp` are reported. The adapter retains a five-degree margin below the reported cutoff and excludes a PAXX12 faulty-toolhead configuration with near-zero `max_power`.
- `printer.control.extrusion.extrude` and `.retract` move only the currently active, detected extruder. They are limited to **0.1–10 mm** at **0.1–10 mm/s**, require an idle printer, the live `can_extrude` flag, and a temperature at or above that extruder's reported minimum (Klipper's default is 170 °C). The generated script uses relative extrusion only and restores the saved G-code state.

Capability and error diagnostics are published below `printer.control.toolhead`: the detected macro names, whether `CHANGE_TOOL`/`LANE_UNLOAD` are usable, current command availability, a human-readable reason, and the latest rejected or failed control request. Existing AFC monitoring under `printer.afc` is retained; no AFC, Spoolman, camera, fan, or v0.0.3 control state is renamed or removed. In PAXX12 mode, AFC status is queried for the toolhead safety check even if the optional direct Spoolman integration is off; no Spoolman data is written.

The supported AFC Lite macros are verified against [the PAXX12 AFC Lite configuration](https://github.com/paxx12-snapmaker-u1/SnapmakerU1-Extended-Firmware/blob/main/overlays/firmware-extended/31-feature-afc-lite/root/usr/local/share/firmware-config/tweaks/klipper/afc.cfg). Capability discovery uses Moonraker's documented [printer-object list and query endpoints](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external_api/printer/). Target temperatures and active-extruder behavior use Klipper's documented [`SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE` and multi-extruder commands](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html). This adapter release has unit tests, not a physical validation of the v0.0.4 action paths: keep attendance and verify macro behaviour on the actual printer before routine use.

**Deutsch:** Die Werkzeugfunktionen sind absichtlich optional. Ohne erkannte PAXX12-Makros und AFC-Status sendet der Adapter keinen Wechsel-/Entladebefehl. Parken bleibt deaktiviert, da dafür kein verifiziertes Makro vorliegt.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer and ioBroker Admin 7.6.20 or newer. CI covers Node.js 22, 24 and 26.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The repository was generated with the official [`@iobroker/create-adapter`](https://github.com/ioBroker/create-adapter) tooling and uses TypeScript, JSON Config, adapter tests, and GitHub Actions.

## Releases

A version tag is accepted only when it matches the version in `package.json` and points to a commit on `main`. After all CI checks pass:

- a stable tag such as `v0.0.4` is published to npm as `latest`, then a normal GitHub release is created;
- a pre-release tag such as `v0.0.5-beta.1` is published to npm as `next`, then a GitHub pre-release is created.

This keeps the GitHub **Latest** release and npm's `latest` tag aligned. Existing versions published before this automation are not changed retroactively.

## Roadmap

1. Validate v0.0.4 tool change, lane unload, temperature, and manual extrusion paths on a physical PAXX12 U1, then document the tested firmware/macro combination.
2. Add a parking control only after a U1/PAXX12 parking macro and its safe preconditions are documented and physically validated.
3. Validate Moonraker payloads and capabilities on a physical U1 running original firmware before enabling any control for it.
4. Extend automated tests for print, material and media data.
5. Validate shutdown and restart in compact mode.
6. Add direct Spoolman inventory access if required.
